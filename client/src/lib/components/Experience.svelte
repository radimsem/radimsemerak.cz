            TypeScript
        </h2>
        <p>
            In my journey I've improved my skills in frontend development using TypeScript. 
            I've utilized frameworks like Svelte and SvelteKit, which are known for their simplicity and performance, 
            to build applications that are not only user-friendly but also efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            HTMX is another option that got me into simplifying the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.
            It allows me to leverage HTML attributes to add dynamic behavior to my applications, 
            enabling me to build web applications with minimal JavaScript code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vite, my go-to build tool, has enabled me to develop quickly and maintain a lean codebase. 
            Additionally, Tailwind CSS has helped me with rapid UI design, allowing me to create visually appealing applications with ease.
