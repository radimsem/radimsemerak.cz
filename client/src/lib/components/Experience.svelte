            Svelte
        </h2>
        <p>
            With a strong background in React and a keen interest in performance and simplicity, 
            I've found myself increasingly interested in Svelte. Svelte stands out for its unique approach to building user interfaces. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional frameworks like React, Svelte shifts the bulk of its work into a compile step that happens when you build your app, 
            converting your app into ideal JavaScript at build time. 
            This means there's no performance cost of the framework's abstractions, and no penalty when your app first loads.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            SvelteKit
        </h3>
        <p>
            My experience with Svelte has also given me exposure to SvelteKit, a framework for building Jamstack web applications. 
            It offers server-side rendering, components, scoped CSS, file-system-based routing, and code-splitting, among other features. 
            This has allowed me to build robust, high-performing applications with Svelte.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            TypeScript
        </h3>
        <p>
            In terms of tooling, I've leveraged TypeScript extensively with Svelte, 
            taking advantage of its strong typing and object-oriented features to write cleaner, more maintainable code. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            Vite
        </h3>
        <p>
            Moreover, I've used Vite as a build tool, which offers fast page reload and optimal build times, further enhancing the development experience.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            Tailwind
        </h3>
        <p>
            In addition to Svelte and SvelteKit, I also employ Tailwind CSS for UI styling. 
            Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a flexible and efficient approach to building custom user interfaces. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Bootstrap, which provides pre-styled components, 
            Tailwind CSS provides low-level utility classes that allow developers to build unique designs without leaving their HTML. 
            This approach provides a smaller CSS file size, leading to faster load times.
        </p>

            Rust
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a seasoned developer with extensive experience in backend languages, 
            I've found Rust to be a compelling choice for various projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, concurrency, and performance, 
            offering a different perspective compared to traditional languages like C and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of Rust's standout features is its memory safety mechanism. 
            Rust's ownership system enables fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, 
            ensuring memory safety at compile-time without the need for a garbage collector.
            This system helps prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferences, data races, and use-after-free bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rust also supports zero-cost abstractions, which means that the abstractions have little to no runtime overhead. 
            This allows developers to write high-level code without sacrificing performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, my journey with Rust has been a rewarding one. It has allowed me to write efficient, safe, and performant code, 
            and has broadened my understanding of systems programming. I look forward to leveraging Rust's strengths in my future projects.

            Kotlin
        </h2>
        <p>
            Kotlin has proven to be a compelling alternative to Java for Android app development. 
            Developed by JetBrains, Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that is fully interoperable with Java, 
            allowing developers to leverage their existing Java skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key reasons why I chose Kotlin over Java is its concise syntax. 
            Kotlin's syntax is clean and expressive, which reduces the amount of boilerplate code and makes the code easier to read and write. 
            This leads to faster development times and improved maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kotlin also introduces null safety, a feature that prevents null pointer exceptions, a common issue in Java. 
            This feature makes Kotlin code safer and more reliable.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            Jetpack Compose
        </h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to UI development for Android apps, I use Jetpack Compose. 
            Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
        </p>
        <p>
            It simplifies UI development and offers a declarative way to define UI components. 
            This approach results in more readable and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, Kotlin's modern features, interoperability with Java, and support for Jetpack Compose make it an excellent choice for Android app development. 
            It allows me to write clean, efficient, and safe code, resulting in high-quality Android applications.

        <h2 class="text-2xl heading">
            Tauri
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have also gained experience with Tauri, a framework for building lightweight, secure, and cross-platform desktop applications. 
            At the core of every Tauri app lies a Rust binary that handles windows, the webview, and calls to the operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows Tauri to offer a small bundle size and strong performance, which is especially beneficial for resource-constrained devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tauri's ability to seamlessly integrate with any frontend framework, including SvelteKit, 
            makes it an excellent choice for creating modern, performant desktop applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            This integration allows developers to leverage the power of Rust for backend logic and the convenience of SvelteKit for UI development, 
            resulting in highly performant native desktop apps

            SQL
        </h2>
        <p>
            With its structured data handling and ACID properties, has always been a preferred choice for me over NoSQL databases. 
            SQL's ACID properties ensure the reliability and consistency of database changes, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            PostgreSQL
        </h3>
        <p>
            As for the choice of SQL dialect, I primarily use PostgreSQL as an ORM. 
            PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with 
            many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I also have experience with MySQL and MariaDB, which are popular open-source relational database management systems. 
            Both MySQL and MariaDB are compatible with SQL and offer robust features for managing structured data.
        </p>

            React
        </h3>
        <p>
            React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook, known for its efficient and flexible way of building user interfaces. 
            It follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            C/C++
        </h3>
        <p>
            These two are powerful languages that allow direct manipulation of memory and hardware, making it ideal for system programming and game development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its efficiency and control over system resources make it a popular choice for high-performance computing applications.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl heading">
            Java
        </h3>
        <p>
            Java is the language that we learn at school, its an object-oriented programming language that offers robustness, security, and portability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its 'write once, run anywhere' capability makes it versatile for a wide range of applications, 
            from enterprise-scale applications to embedded systems.
